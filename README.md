# TRex ðŸ¦–

TRex makes OCR easy and accessible on a Mac. 

But what is OCR anyway? Imagine you have a PDF file or a Web page where you can't select the text, image with text on it, or even a YouTube video. Forget retyping it manually; with TRex, you can extract text from anywhere, and it is as easy as taking a screenshot.

TRex lives in the menu bar and available right where you need it the most:
